StoryDev-Engine
===============
This is going to be an interactive story engine and editor in-one, written in Haxe on the OpenFL framework. It is designed to make writing interactive stories easier in a user-friendly way for both the author and the programmer. The engine part of this product is almost done; all that needs to be done is corrections with custom links and it will be optimised for Flash and C++ targets (the main aim of this project).

In addition, there will also be an editor. The editor is going to be designed for both the author and the programmer in mind; it will provide tools for the programmer to write code and express it in a way that is easy to read and use the in-built functions this engine comes with; in addition, it will also provide WYSIWYG interfaces for authors who do not know how to code to easily write stories without the hassle of coding.

If you wish to contribute to this project, please fork and add new features or you can complete some tasks on our TODO list below. When requesting a Pull, please make a link to a working copy of your part of the contribution so that it can be easily merged with the master branch without hassle to other coders. If it is a work-in-progress copy, make a pull request to the Dev branch, where most of the work-in-progress content resides.

TODO

* General code cleanup

EDITOR
======
The editor will consist of a lot of features that will go into extensive testing and details. Since it is going to be difficult to complete in a reasonable time and show you how it is going, contributions to the editor will be left out of the dev branch and put into the editor branch.
